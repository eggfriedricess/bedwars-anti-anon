THIS OVERLAY IS PURELY USED FOR QOL, AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGES TO THE USER.

A recent update release by Hypixel has hidden player usernames in pre-game lobbies. This has caused the game to be less rewarding, and in turn, less fun.
This update also makes it harder to deal with cheaters in-game.

✔️ Features status✔️

All stars, Fkdr, Winstreak in pre-lobby: ✔️

Denicker: works 50/50 (will say if there is a nick though)

autododge: In progress (just need to fix the settings for it, will come out in future update)

As of September 2024, this overlay still works in-game. 

INSTALLATION

GUIDE:
1. run the file
2. Put in your hypixel username
3. minimize the application to how you like it
4. queue a game!
