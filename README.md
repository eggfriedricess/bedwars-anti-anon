THIS OVERLAY IS PURELY USED FOR QOL, AND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGES TO THE USER.

A recent update release by Hypixel has hidden player usernames in pre-game lobbies. This has caused the game to be less rewarding, and in turn, less fun.
This update also makes it harder to deal with cheaters in-game.
